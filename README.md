# Train_Timetabling_with_Operational_Strategies
This repository contains the supplementary materials for our paper “_Train timetabling with rolling stock assignment, short-turning and skip-stop strategy for a bidirectional metro line._” It includes the datasets, model parameters, and Python scripts required to reproduce the main computational results. In particular, we provide the network topology, static OD matrices, and simulated time-dependent OD demand based on the 30–50–20 station demand profile, along with all key parameters (e.g., h_{min}, h_{max}, C, κ, s_k, station profiles ϕ_i[u], and OD shares). A reproducibility script to regenerate Table 7 (Row 1) is available in the data/Reproducibility script/ folder, and step-by-step instructions to run it are provided in the main README.
