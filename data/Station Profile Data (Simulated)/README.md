This folder contains the simulated time-dependent passenger demand profiles used in our paper “_Train timetabling with rolling stock assignment, short-turning and skip-stop strategy for a bidirectional metro line._” Since real station-level time-varying demand data was not available, we generated a simple but realistic 30–50–20 temporal demand pattern to represent peak-hour concentration. Specifically, the planning horizon is divided into three equal time segments: 30% of arrivals occur in the first segment, 50% in the middle segment (peak concentration), and 20% in the final segment, with the total share summing to 1 for each station. We also construct time-dependent O–D destination shares by grouping downstream destinations into near/mid/far categories and distributing demand across these groups using the same 30–50–20 split. This approach is consistent with prior metro timetabling and rolling stock planning studies that represent passenger arrivals using interval-based demand profiles (e.g., Shi et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2016; Zhu and Goverde, 2020).
