To reproduce the computational results reported in Table 7 (Row 1), run the Python script Table_7_Row_1.py. This script builds and solves the corresponding Gurobi optimization model using the input data provided in the Excel file Input_Parameters.xlsx. Please make sure that Python, Gurobi, and the required packages (such as pandas) are installed on your system. Place the script and the Excel file in the same directory (or update the file path in the code accordingly), and then execute the script using: python Table_7_Row_1.py. After execution, the script prints the optimized decision variables (e.g., timetable, service patterns, and turnarounds), along with key congestion-related performance metrics such as Peak Load Factor (PLF), Congestion Duration (CD), Left-Behind Passenger Rate (LBPR), and Demand-to-Capacity Ratio (DCR).
