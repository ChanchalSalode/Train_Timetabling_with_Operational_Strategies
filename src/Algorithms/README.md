This folder contains reference implementations of the main methods used in our paper:"Train timetabling with rolling stock assignment, short-turning and skip-stop strategy for a bidirectional metro line."

The scripts in this folder are provided to give a clear overview of how the proposed algorithms and time-dependent demand construction were implemented.

## Folder Structure
- `Algorithms/` Contains implementations of the solution approaches used in the paper, including:
  - Classical epsilon-constraint method (baseline)
  - Hybrid epsilon-constraint Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (Hybrid e-LBBD)
  - Queue-Integrated Fixed-Point Optimization (QFPO)
  - Time Dependent Off-peak Model 1
